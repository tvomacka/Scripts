# Scripts

## Quick Tips
The scripts (at least development.ps1 for Windows machines) need to be run as Administrator, otherwise some components such as Sublime Text will not be installed.

## Windows
development.ps1

## TODO
 - Add C/C++ compiler to MSVS
 - Image manipulation tools (at least Paint.NET and InkScape)
 - Package installation to Sublime Text (JSON re-indent)
 - Make sure the C/C++ development is possible in MSVC and VSC (compilation, etc.)
